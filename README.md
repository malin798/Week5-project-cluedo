# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Technigo assignment. The focus on this project is to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

## The problem

Follwed the instructions and added the objects and arrays first. Then added functionality to the cards and buttons. Getting the cards to flip properly on all browsers was difficult since the layering on safari works differently.Lastly I made some design-improvements.
